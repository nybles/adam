* Head towards the [\_posts directory](https://github.com/fossiiita/blog/tree/master/_posts) (on your own fork).
* Create a new file for your post, taking [this text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossiiita/blog/master/help.md) as reference for the format.
* Make sure the filename is like `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`.

* Once you are done, [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) for your post to be published.
